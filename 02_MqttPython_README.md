Sure! Below is a simple Python MQTT application using the Paho MQTT client library, along with full documentation in Markdown format.

### MQTT Application with Paho

This application demonstrates how to create a simple MQTT client using the Paho MQTT library in Python. The client will connect to an MQTT broker, publish messages to a topic, and subscribe to that topic to receive messages.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Paho MQTT library

You can install the Paho MQTT library using pip:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt
```

#### Directory Structure

```
mqtt_app/
│
├── mqtt_client.py
└── README.md
```

#### mqtt_client.py

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import time

# Define the MQTT settings
BROKER = "192.168.22.253"  # Public broker for testing
PORT = 1883                   # Default MQTT port
TOPIC = "test/topic_python"          # Topic to publish and subscribe

# Callback when the client receives a CONNACK response from the server
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print(f"Connected with result code {rc}")
    client.subscribe(TOPIC)  # Subscribe to the topic

# Callback when a message is received from the server
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f"Received message: {msg.payload.decode()} on topic: {msg.topic}")

# Create an MQTT client instance
client = mqtt.Client()

# Assign the callback functions
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

# Connect to the broker
client.connect(BROKER, PORT, 60)

# Start the loop to process network traffic and dispatch callbacks
client.loop_start()

try:
    while True:
        # Publish a message to the topic
        message = "Hello MQTT!"
        client.publish(TOPIC, message)
        print(f"Published message: {message} to topic: {TOPIC}")
        time.sleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds before publishing again
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Exiting...")
finally:
    client.loop_stop()  # Stop the loop
    client.disconnect()  # Disconnect from the broker
```

# MQTT Application with Paho

This repository contains a simple MQTT client application built using the Paho MQTT library in Python. The client connects to an MQTT broker, publishes messages to a specified topic, and subscribes to that topic to receive messages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Paho MQTT library

## Installation

To install the Paho MQTT library, run the following command:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `mqtt_client.py` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `mqtt_client.py`.
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python mqtt_client.py
   ```

4. The client will connect to the MQTT broker and start publishing messages to the specified topic every 5 seconds. It will also print any messages received on that topic.

## Configuration

You can modify the following variables in `mqtt_client.py` to customize the application:

- `BROKER`: The address of the MQTT broker (default is `mqtt.eclipse.org`).
- `PORT`: The port to connect to the broker (default is `1883`).
- `TOPIC`: The topic to publish and subscribe to (default is `test/topic`).

## Callback Functions

- `on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc)`: This function is called when the client connects to the broker. It subscribes to the specified topic.
- `on_message(client, userdata, msg)`: This function is called when a message is received on the subscribed topic. It prints the message and the topic.

### Running the Application

1. Save the `mqtt_client.py` and `README.md` files in a directory.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to that directory.
3. Run the application using the command:

   ```bash
   python mqtt_client.py
   ```

4. You should see messages being published and received in the terminal.

### Conclusion

This simple MQTT application demonstrates how to use the Paho MQTT library to create a client that can publish and subscribe to messages. You can expand this application by adding more features, such as handling different message types or connecting to a secure broker.
